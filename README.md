üéØ Objective: The objective of this project is to analyze salary trends in the tech industry based on various factors such as job titles, experience levels, employment types, locations, and remote work impact. The analysis will be visualized through interactive dashboards using Power BI, providing insights that can guide career decisions, policy-making, and organizational strategies.

ü§î Analyze salary distribution across job titles, experience levels, and years.
Could you look over the impact of remote work on salaries?
Compare salaries between different locations.
Analyze company size distribution and its impact on salaries.

üíª Data Source: You can find the dataset on Kaggle at: https://app.powerbi.com/groups/me/reports/aa70c776-89a4-4928-88e2-476c541fa62f/868909122ada733b9270

üìä Attributes:
The dataset consists of various attributes including work year, experience level, employment type, job title, salary, salary in USD, employee residence, remote ratio, company location, and company size

# Tools and Technologies:

- SQL: For data cleaning, analysis, and initial visualizations.
- Power BI: For creating interactive and detailed dashboards.

üìä Tasks to Approach the Project:

# Data Analysis with SQL:

## Task 1: Analyze salary trends based on job titles, experience levels, and locations.

## Task 2: Determine the impact of remote work on salaries.

## Task 3: Compare salary distributions across different company sizes and locations.

## Task 4: Evaluate salary growth over the years.



# Data Visualization with Power BI:

Create interactive dashboards to visualize the insights derived from SQL analysis.

## Task 1: Highlight key metrics such as salary distribution by Job Title(Highest Salary, Maximum Salary and Average Salary by job title)

## Task 2: Top 5 Average Salary by Job Title

## Task 3: Salary Distribution by Experience 

## Task 4: Salary Trends Over the Years

## Task 5: Remote Work Ratio Analysis

## Task 6: Salary Distribution by Company Size

## Task 7: Geographical Insights highlighting salary distributions across employee locations and company locations

## Task 8: Employee Location Analysis


### üéØProject Highlights:

- Revealed that Machine Learning Engineers had the highest average salaries.
- Showcased the positive impact of remote work on salary levels.
  - Remote work is categorized as:
    - 0: No remote work
    - 50: Partially remote
    - 100: Fully remote
    - 0 (No remote): 7 instances
    - 100 (Fully remote): 8 instances
    - There is a significant split between fully remote and no remote work.
    - Fully remote positions include Machine Learning Engineers, Data Scientists, and Data Engineers.
- Demonstrated salary growth trends over the years.
  - Salaries in 2023 and 2024 show a trend of higher salaries for certain roles such as Machine Learning Engineers and Data Scientists.
  - The highest salary in 2023 is for a Data Scientist (297300 USD).
  - The highest salary in 2024 is for a Data Scientist (255475 USD).
- Provided geographical insights into salary distributions.
  - All the companies are located in the US except one in GB (Great Britain). 

## Conclusion:

By the end of this project, we aim to provide actionable insights that can benefit both employers and employees in the tech industry.
This analysis will help in understanding the current salary landscape and predicting future trends.
